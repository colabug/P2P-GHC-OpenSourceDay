Would it unreasonable to require women to go to a center for first time
registration of cell phone numbers? For subsequent phone registrations?

 Fonkoze collects data from the center using a paper form. So you can imagine
 two scenarios:
 1. The first registration members come to the center to do it and, after that
    for updating information they'll use a mobile application
 2: Call the call center to register

Can center employees collect these numbers? Do we need a technological
solution?

    Yes we need to perform the existing solution. For right now they use the
    Emerge database to collect data. The issue is if the members change phone
    numbers FONKOZE doesn’t have a way to have the new ones.
  
Will a woman be associated with a certain center?

    Fonkoze has a unique interface which is the main contact for fonkoze.

Is there internet connectivity at the centers?

    46 branches of fonkoze have connectivity
   
What kind of database do you have? How can we connect to it?

   This database isn’t an open source so we can’t get the possibility to change
   anything. But we can develop an application to interact with this database or
   may be plug in.
     
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
* What’s the information that you need to collect from each woman?
* Would it be reasonable to collect the information at the vendor level? Where
  are SIM cards typically bought? Do you keep the phones and just replace the
  SIM cards?
