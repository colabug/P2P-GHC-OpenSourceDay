OVERVIEW
This project was started as a proof of concept during the Grace Hopper
Conference's Open Source Day 2011. After colloboration with project participants
and the team in Haiti, the requirements led us to design this prototype.

It is fairly barebones now, but if fleshed out, it will enable call center
representatives to register current phone numbers for the market women in Haiti.
As this information may change often, ease of use and training is favored for
keeping this data up to date.

This can be achieved through simple web forms generated to capture important
information for each woman. It would be maintained with the admin interface
provided by Django. Not sure if the intention is to have each center
have a separate database for their region or if the database should be shared
across the entire country.

In addition to the prototype, we have included a document from the requirements
gathering phase which was generated through colloboration with the students in
Haiti.

PROTOTYPE
The operations you can currently preform are creating new users and call
centers. Also you can also edit, delete, and view records.

To start the server:

    python manage.py runserver
    Note: If starting fresh, it will have you create a superuser so you can log
          into the browser.

To view in browser:

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

To clear database:

    python manage.py flush

NEXT STEPS
We used Django to implement the prototypem please see this for more information
if the project will be expanded.
